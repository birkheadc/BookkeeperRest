# TODO

- Add setting for when to automatically back up. Maybe on every report, or once a day, etc.

- Add a way to change e-mail address to send back-ups to.

- Refactor all of the user-settings nonsense. Do not give the front-end free reign over the settings, that was not a good idea for multiple reasons. Not the least of which being that it actually ends up being MORE complicated on the front end.
